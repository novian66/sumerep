### ü§î What is SUMEREP?

SUMEREP (abbreviated from Student Medical Report) is a web-based software used to manage student health and provide reports for students, teachers, and community health centers.


**Software functions:**
- There are three users of the software: students, teachers, and community health centers.
- Student users have the authority to fill in personal health data based on self-assessment. The aspects of self-health include mental health (psychological well-being, reproductive knowledge, learning motivation).
- Teacher users play a role in filling out health examination forms for each student. Health data that teachers can input based on observation and measurement include vital signs examination (blood pressure, pulse, temperature, lung and heart sounds); nutrition examination (weight, height, body mass index, stunting, signs of anemia); fitness examination (time and distance covered based on gender and age during running tests); personal hygiene examination (hair, nails, skin cleanliness).
- Community health center users (assigned doctors) play a role in inputting student health during health examinations, such as ear and mouth health, the use of aids, and providing recommendations to each student.
- The output of this software is student health reports that can be assessed by students, teachers, and community health centers, depending on their roles.


**SUMEREP development strategy is to:**
- Make it easy for users to obtain SUMEREP freely, without bureaucratic processes.
- Facilitate users in absorbing new SUMEREP releases.
- Allow programmers to make direct contributions to the source code of the SUMEREP application.


**SUMEREP is managed on GitHub to:**
- Record all changes made.
- Allow reverting to previous revisions if necessary.
- Facilitate collaboration among programmers and also with partner organizations in developing SUMEREP.
- Online backup of SUMEREP source code that can be accessed at any time.
